# swing-spy
## What is this for ?
If you are a plugin developer for Eclipse, you may use Alt+Shift+F1 to trigger [Eclipse Plug-in Spy](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseCodeAccess/article.html#plug-in-spy-for-ui-parts).
But you can't find some thing like that in Intellij IDEA. So this is for Intellij IDEA plugin developers to see implementation of gui elements.

## How to use it ?
Just install the `swing-spy.jar` as a plugin and restart and double click `Ctrl` key to trigger spy action , it will show a popup which inculdes all components that contain current mouse position.
